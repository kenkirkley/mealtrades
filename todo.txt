TODO:

Make a signup page and make it work. Things to check:
If user is created successfuly
If Password is encoded successfuly
If Email is sent
If the link in the email works
If cookie is sent

Make a forgot password link
Forgot Password page needs a input for the email
check if email is sent and if link in email works
Link in email needs to take you to a page where you can input a new password. May need to make a new route that takes a password reset token as 
/:id
needs two input boxes: new password, and password confirm.
After that it should log you in

When user logs out, link should go to home page.

FOR THE PROJECT:
CREATE A NEW ROUTE FOR POST CONSUMPTION:
2. Send confirmation request to creator
3. Send notice to user of result
4. Connect users
Things to think about here:
See if instead of clicking a confirmation link, the user can send a response message to confirm/deny. (THIS IS POSSIBLE READ NEXMO DOCS) Server will need to be prepared to recieve and parse such a message and respond by sending the consumer a message. If not, confirmation link and route will suffice?

UPDATE/DELETE OFFER:
1. Check if creator is same as one on offer
(Decode the jwt in req.cookies.jwt or the bearer token (see authController.protect) and compare to offer.creator)


--------------------------------------------

ON SINGLE OFFER PAGE:
Will need to use get offer route. Do you need email in query? if not change in popOptions

for texts:
when the user enters their phone number: use
replace(/\D/g, '') : takes out non numeric chars

server side:

when storing number, if in US add 1 infront of number

nexmo.message.sendSms('12011785085', 18322170123, textMessage, {type: 'unicode}, (err, responseData) => {
    if(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
    else{
        console.dir(responseData);
    }
} )
