TODO:

Make a signup page and make it work. Things to check:
If user is created successfuly
If Password is encoded successfuly
If Email is sent
If the link in the email works
If cookie is sent

Make a forgot password link
Forgot Password page needs a input for the email
check if email is sent and if link in email works
Link in email needs to take you to a page where you can input a new password. May need to make a new route that takes a password reset token as 
/:id
needs two input boxes: new password, and password confirm.
After that it should log you in

When user logs out, link should go to home page.
