-------------------------------------------------
Goals:
1. Create Front end layouts for project
2. Finish consumer/creator interactions through sms.

Next: See Front End.
Watch the end of the node course for deployment.

make single listing page.

Consumption: Need to make a front end confirmation page with accept or deny buttons that will send differing post requests depending on accept or deny. Use different axios requests with the last accept parameter to confirm/deny.
Need to hide listing when someone shows interest? or leave it up and let multiple people show interest? if latter, then will have to notify other interested parties when a post is no longer available? or just leave them hanging. keep text price in mind. Gonna need a bigger picture.

Things to look out for:
Changed the overview in views controller. the / route just goes to home page.

WHEN USER UPDATES INFO, THEIR INFO IS NOT UPDATED ON ANY ACTIVE OFFERS THEY HAVE!!!!

Question of the day: Do we make them fill in bio/images/about me/tagline on signup, or sign them up first then ask them to update their information?
Other question: Do we send phonenumbers? and who to?
-------------------------------------------------
TODO:
-------------------------------------------------

Post Consumption:
Status: In progress
Todo:  Add consumer to offer when consumed. Create confirmation link with offer and consumer as params. Create link in consumeOffer. Will need to make a route for this. Page will have consumer info with confirm or deny buttons. Create confirmation link route.
-------------------------------------------------
CREATE A NEW ROUTE FOR POST CONSUMPTION:
2. Send confirmation request to creator
3. Send notice to user of result
4. Connect users (send respective contact info)

Flow:
1. Post consume request
    a. Message sent to creator with confirmation link. Link will have consumer info with buttons to confirm or deny.(offerController.consumeOffer) 
    b. Show on front end: A message has been sent to $CREATOR. You will be notified of their response shortly
    c. Creator clicks button on link (link needs to include the offer id)
    d. Send appropriate message to consumer. (This happens on a new route!)
    e. link two parties.


ADD CONSUMER TO OFFER!!!!!
1. When consumer consumes offer, send messages confirming. Consumer is added to offer.
3. If there is a consumer on the offer, take the listed offer off of the site. if consumer, do not show on front end. 
4. What happens if two consumers consume at the same time?
    a. While there is a consumer on the offer, do not show the offer. Once the creator denies, take creator off of the offer. This will allow the offer to show back up on the front end. If the creator accepts, then there will still be a consumer on the offer, therefore it will not show up on the front end.

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

Single Offer page
Status: Api functional
Todo: Create Front End for single offer. Must have consumer attach functionality on front end.
-------------------------------------------------
Review api functionality. Need to attach consumer to offer. Send consumer with axios request. Handle on backend. Remap it out so you understand. If creator clicks offer, then it should take to edit offer page.
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------


Front End:
Status: In progress
Todo: PRIORITY 1!!!!!!!!!!! Create schematic of website to take inventory of all front end pages required. Handle errors in a way that is suitable for deployment. (404, etc)
Put if statement, if there are no offers currently, replace offers div with some text.
Before processing images, create the user page and the single listing page/lightbox. These pages will have a picture of the user.
Need to process images with multer in a way that matches our layout.
Multer operations need to be used on signup if the user uploads an image, and on update. Currently it is only on update. 
-------------------------------------------------
COMPLETED:

REVIEW:
home (Current home page can be about page.)
footer
header (user drop down menu)
login
forgotPassword
emailSent
resetPassword
error
Listing on home page
Listing mixin
my account page (when uploading photo, need some indication of file)


NOT STARTED:

Single listing(lightbox)
Consumption confirmation page (similar format to one above.)
Signup page 2 with user info?? See question of the day.
Map of local listings page.

user page
about page
privacy and terms of conditions
contact


------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------

Signup:
Status: Basic 
Todo: needs specific functionality, need to be able to check for a valid tamu email.
-----------------------------------------------
Make a signup page and make it work. Things to check:

1. It works, but:
    When testing locally, the cookie will not be sent, as it can only be sent over https.

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------


Forgot Password:
Status: Mvp
Todo: Make more front end designs for error states. Streamline user exp. by taking them to the appropriate pages.
Make a page to send them to after they click the forgot password button.
EMAIL WILL ONLY SEND IN PRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------
Make a forgot password link
Done, but:
1. FIND A BETTER WAY TO GET THE TOKEN FROM THE URL TO THE AXIOS REQUEST. As of right now, the token is being passed to the pug template from the back end, then the token is attached to the button id, then that id is sent to the axios request. How to get the token straight from the url?????
2. This will not log in immediately in testing, as testing locally is not done over https.
3. Make pages for error states. If token is invalid or expired, send back to forgot password? or something. as of right now, there are only push notifications.
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------


Update/Delete offer
Status: Almost Complete
Todo: Needs validation
-------------------------------------------------
UPDATE/DELETE OFFER:
1. Check if creator is same as one on offer
(Decode the jwt in req.cookies.jwt or the bearer token (see authController.protect) and compare to offer.creator)

KEEP AN EYE OUT ON NEW DECODE FUNCTION. TEST AUTHORIZARTION THOROUGHLY

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phone Numbers:
Status: Needs front end
Todo: Needs a place to input on front end.

BASIC TEXT DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------
for texts:
when the user enters their phone number: use
replace(/\D/g, '') : takes out non numeric chars

server side:

when storing number, if in US add 1 infront of number

nexmo.message.sendSms('12011785085', 18322170123, textMessage, {type: 'unicode}, (err, responseData) => {
    if(err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
    else{
        console.dir(responseData);
    }
} )

on free trial, whitelist numbers
dashboard.nexmo.com/test-numbers

look into conversations on nexmo for handling user communication.
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

TO TEST RECIEVING SMS:
1. Install ngrok so that nexmo can detect the endpoint for recieving SMS
2. configure your virtual number. Add the endpoint that you want the messages to be handled on.
3. use code snippet provided on https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/code-snippets/receiving-an-sms. make a route that matches the endpoint on the virtual number, then make a controller function that handles what to do with that message.
4. When recieving the message, send short acknowledgement reply, then send message to the person who consumed the offer saying whether or not they accepted. 
a. Test the response. In message, say "Respond Yes to accept, or No to deny." use an if statement with the text of the message to see what they said. If neither, send a message that says only reply yes or no.
b. If yes, set message contents to x. If no, set message contents to y.
c. With these message contents, send message to the consumer with the appropriate response.


d. (OPTIONAL). Turn to conversation mode and connect users. Any further replies will be sent back and forth between users. May need a new endpoint for this? or instead, separate the initial interaction into one function, and the subsequent interactions into another. Or, at this point, connect the users by exchanging the numbers? or emails. 

This is the connection point between users.
This will require more thought.

MULTER USAGE GUIDE AND THOUGHTS:
Pressing Thought: If we save a smaller, resized image that is more optimized, loading that image makes the image look blurrier as opposed to loading a higher res image then sizing it down.
Higher res is less optimal for web, but it looks better. Resized is more optimal, but looks shitty. What do?

Need to process images with multer in a way that matches our layout.
Multer operations need to be used on signup if the user uploads an image, and on update. Currently it is only on update. 
The photo is added to the user by uploading a photo, creating a file name for that photo, attaching the file name to the request, then when the updateMe function is called, it assigns the photo field of the user to the file name in the request.


When you decide what sizes are needed for the front end, adjust the multer functions in user controller accordingly. Right now, the sizes are 500x500 and 72x72. 
How to use the photos:
The base filename is stored in the photo attribute of the user. When the base size (currently 500x500) is needed, just access the photo attribute. When other sizes are needed, add the size extension to the name of the file(ie. filename-72x72.jpeg). The other sizes are saved, but the direct reference to the names of these files are not saved. But the base filename of these photos are the same of the original photo.

-------
The current implementation has 2 middleware functions that use multer. If you change the photo in the user model to an array, then pass an array of strings through the request with filenames, then maybe you can just use one multer middleware instead of two identical ones. Not good to have duplicate code. Or you can take another argument in the middleware on the size of photo desired. Then, change front end to load the 72x72 image with the new nomenclature.

Saving one photo name is not bad, but the same function is defined twice as it stands, one for the normal size and a modified one for the other sizes. There is lots of duplicate code here. Mark for refactor.
-------
As of right now, the base filename gets saved to the photo attribute on a user, but multiple photos get saved using multiple functions. Whenever a certain size of photo is desired, the size extension should be added to the name of the photo before insertion on the front end.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other thoughts:

Do we need any verfication for users at all? Verification adds quite a few hurdles and swamps of both legal and structrual nature. From what i've looked up so far, there is no way to get access to the complete school directory. Scraping the search function probably would not work either, as to get someone's info you need their name in the search bar. I dont think we can scrape this.

So maybe we go the leafedin route. Just make it anonymous, maybe require a tamu specific email, and leave the masses to it. Have meal trade meetups or exchanges. People can leave their venmos, and say venmo someone to get them a meal trade for $5 dollars or something like that. Or just give them away for free by saying ima be here at a certain time. That kind of thing. I think the UIN/Student ID route is not feasible.

For now just put the signup requirements on hold. Probably wont use them. Look in to how to verify a certain domain. Could use regular expressions.
-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

Remember to change the Nexmo Webhook to the current ngrok web link. Dont need to do this if we are not recieving messages.

Ways to decrease cost:
1. Use confirmation link instead of response text. This will allow you to have direct access to offer by putting offer id into the confirmation link parameter. Also saves one inbound sms message. (25%)
2. Only send contact info to one party. This will save one outgoing message. Instead of sending both parties the numbers, only one party will get it. Or, have the contact info in the link?

On offer creation, have an option to eat together or eat separately?
Users need bios, as in confirmation link it will show some user info.

See if you can redirect to the a&m portal for UIN authentication?? or just student authentication.
